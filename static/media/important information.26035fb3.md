# How to teach this class

***

## Background

***

This class was originally taught by Darren and Sandra during the summer of 2020 for the HSSP program at MIT for 6 weeks. We hosted 25 students, and attendance averaged at about 22 students per week. Students were originally separated into 8 separate groups of 3-4, but in the later weeks, we found that larger groups were more helpful since many of the students did not have the Java knowledge necessary to complete the challenges effectively and on time. Thus, by week 6, we separated the students into 5 groups.

Typically, each week's class (1.5 hours each) followed a similar format:

1) Teach the design portion of the class. Sandra would do this part, and it would typically take around 10-20 minutes including a breakout discussion.

2) Teach the development portion of the class. Darren would do this part, and it would typically take around 20-30 minutes to code for the students and answer questions.

3) Let the students apply the development concepts via a challenge, which usually constituted the last half hour of the class. Because the application of concepts just learned in class can be difficult and often takes more time to learn how to do, this portion typically went overtime for most weeks; we would end up helping the remaining groups fix and upload their code successfully.

Note that the presentations are primarily used by the design portion of class, whereas development concepts are typically taught via an IDE and not through a slides format.

## How to use this website

***

On the left, we have separated many of the important design and development concepts into tabs to help guide a potential teacher(s) into teaching this class in the future, whether that be through ESP or separately through a different program. 

Additionally, the student resources page is available above under the tab "Student Resources". This is the content that the students were given to work with during class and the challenges.

We encourage potential teachers to consider the design and development components of the class separately; that is, due to the nature of the development portion of class with a dynamic and group-based challenge component, the design portion of this class is much easier to learn and teach to students, while the development portion of this class (along with challenges) is much more involved and requires a lot of knowledge and preparation from the teachers.
