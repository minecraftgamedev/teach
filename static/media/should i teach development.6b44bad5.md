# Should I Teach Minecraft Game Development?

***

### Teaching the game development portion of this class with challenges requires a serious commitment.

***

There are a lot of logistical components that teacher(s) will have to handle before class starts, and teachers must ensure all components for the challenge are up and running for every class.

To get an idea of the requirements you need to teach in the way that this class was taught, here's a checklist of items you should be familiar with and/or know how to work with, as these were concepts used to teach the class originally. If you are unfamiliar with multiple of these items and aren't sure if you can learn all of these concepts before teaching this class, reconsider teaching Minecraft Game Development in the same style as this class.

- You need a STRONG understanding of Minecraft Plugin Development
    
    - Students may ask questions related to topics in class, and you should be able to answer any of them.
    
    - Range of topics taught:
    
        - Event Listener
        - Spigot plugin development
        - JavaPlugin
        - Commands using CommandHandler
        - BukkitRunnable timers
        - Maven
        - BlockState
        - Minecraft UI, including but not limited to: Boss Bars, Chest UI, Scoreboard UI, Title and subtitle UI, ActionBar UI, and Armor Stand Nametag UI
        - Saving and Loading Files through File, FileWriter, and FileReader
        - JSON file format and the GSON library
        - ItemMeta
        
- You will need to know how Maven works

- You need to have a basic understanding of React front-end development to host the plugin file uploading site

- You will also need a basic understanding of NodeJS back-end development to host the API endpoints to download the plugin files uploaded

- You should be familiar with how MongoDB works, especially if you want to show the players live server logs

- You should be comfortable with using the Linux terminal, since many of the automated scripts depend on the usage of Linux bash scripts. Best case you are also running a Linux machine to teach this class, as many scripts that work with loading up the required materials for the class are coded in a .sh file.
