## Background

***

Please read the background information under "Important Information" first.

The prerequisites of the class are for the game development portion of the class. If you only teach game design, these prerequisites may not apply.

In addition to what was said before:

- The class was taught through Zoom for 1.5 hour segments, weekly, on Saturday. This was done under HSSP, which is managed by the ESP organization at MIT.

- We encourage the students to interact as much as possible, and we do that through asking questions throughout, including a breakout room discussion for design, and including a plugin challenge for development.

- The official prerequisites for this class should be as follows:

    - 8-12 graders.

    - Solid knowledge of Java concepts, including object-oriented programming concepts like instances and interfaces
    
    - Knowledge and past experience with playing Minecraft. This is not required, but it is very helpful since the challenges assume you know basic Minecraft concepts and expect you to use them.
    
    - A copy of Minecraft JAVA Edition. If under ESP, we were able to lend Minecraft accounts to students for the duration of the program owned by ESP. Bedrock edition does not work, since the class is developing Java plugins.
    
- In actuality, many of our students did not have much experience with Java going in, which made it a lot more difficult for them to follow along during lecture and complete the challenges on a timely manner. Although it is possible to relax the Java prerequisite to basic programming experience, you will need to teach the students essential Java concepts in addition to teaching Minecraft plugin concepts during class.

## Student Preparation

***

Before the first class, students should have the following ready:

**Download the tools necessary for Java and Minecraft development:**

1) First, make sure you have a JDK downloaded. This will allow you to program in Java. JDK 11 can be found on the website: https://adoptopenjdk.net/ 

2) Next, make sure you have an IDE installed. This will allow you to download and learn the Minecraft plugin library very quickly through the use of autocompletion and automatic documentation. We strongly recommend you download IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition ( https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ ), as we will be conducting all tutorials and demonstrations using this IDE. If you prefer a different IDE, please note that you may have to individually figure out how to mimic shortcut functionality demonstrated with IntelliJ.

3) When IntelliJ finishes installing, we need to change one setting: Go to (File/Configure) -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Development -> Build Tools -> Maven -> Importing, then at the row that says “Automatically download:” make sure Sources and Documentation are checked, click Apply, then OK.

4) Finally, make sure you have Minecraft JAVA edition ( https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/ ) downloaded and installed on your computer for version 1.16.1. We will be using Minecraft on our first day of class. If you do not have a copy of Minecraft JAVA edition and would like us to help, don't hesitate to email us and we can work it out.
    
**Fill out a pre-class survey that helps gauge whether or not students area ready to use Java effectively on day one. To view the survey that we used, see the following link: https://forms.gle/WALB8TmhezUHHDRAA**
