# Teaching Game Design

***

Teaching the game design portion of the class is very much achievable, and all of the content is available through the slides on "Important Information" for use in the future.

If you plan on teaching Game Design without Minecraft Game Development, we would recommend you creating more involvement for the students, as the game design lessons typically took only 10-20 minutes. Additionally, although our class was taught in 1.5 hour segments, teaching only game design should be completely viable in 1 hour segments.

Example:

- Throughout the 6 weeks, students will learn game design principles, and they will apply that by creating actual games together in Scratch/Unity/Godot/etc.
